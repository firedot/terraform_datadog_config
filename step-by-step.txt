# This is a step-by-step guid for how the configuration was built

- Define the provider that is going to be used:
```provider "google" {
    credentials = "${file(/home/test/creds.json)}"
    project = "test-proj-241215"
    region = "${var.google_region}"

}
```
- Define a ```random_pet``` resource, that is going to be used to generate the srv names:

```
resource "random_pet" "srv_name" {
    length = 4
    prefix = "srv-"

}
```
- Define ```random_pet``` resource that is going to be used to generate names of other than servers resources:
```
resource "random_pet" "other_resource" {
    length = 10
    prefix = "other-"

}
````

- Create a ```google_compute_instance``` resource:

```
resource "google_compute_instance" "server_1" {
      name         = "${random_pet.srv_name.id}"
        machine_type = "n1-standard-1"
          zone         = "${var.google_zone}"
            tags         = ["first-macihne", "testing"]

            boot_disk = {
                initialize_params {
                          image = "ubuntu-1810-cosmic-v20190514"
                              
                }
                  
            }

      network_interface {
              network = "default"
                
      }

}
```

- Create ```outputs.tf``` that will show the name of the created instance

```
output "google_compute_instance server_1 name " {
      value = "${google_compute_instance.server_1.name}"

}

```

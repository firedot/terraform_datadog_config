# This is a step-by-step guid for how the configuration was built

- Define the provider that is going to be used:
```provider "google" {
    credentials = "${file(/home/test/creds.json)}"
    project = "test-proj-241215"
    region = "${var.google_region}"

}
```
- Define a ```random_pet``` resource, that is going to be used to generate the srv names:

```
resource "random_pet" "srv_name" {
    length = 4
    prefix = "srv-"

}
```
- Define ```random_pet``` resource that is going to be used to generate names of other than servers resources:
```
resource "random_pet" "other_resource" {
    length = 10
    prefix = "other-"

}
